## One-Version Rule

This package implements a version of Google's `One-Version Rule`:

> For every dependency in [a] repository, there must be only one version of that dependency to choose.<sup>2</sup>

Please refer to the [implementation notes](ONE-VERSION.md) for our specific evaluation criteria.

There is some overlap between this tool and [experimental yarn constraints](https://yarnpkg.com/features/constraints), without requiring use of a particular package manager.

## Getting Started

Install `@wayfair/one-version` at the workspace root using yarn:

```bash
yarn add --dev -w @wayfair/one-version
```

Or pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add -save-dev -w @wayfair/one-version
```

Add the following section to your package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "one-version:check": "one-version check -p ${yarn | pnpm}"
  }
}

```

The `-p` flag is not required if using `pnpm`.

Run `yarn one-version:check` or `pnpm run one-version:check`.

If the repo is compliant, the tool will print this message:

```text
âœ¨ One Version Rule Success - found no version conflicts!
```  

If the repo is not compliant, you will see a version of this message:

```text
ðŸš« One Version Rule Failure - found multiple versions of the following dependencies:

prettier
  2.1.2
    dev: @wayfair/app-a, @wayfair/app-b
  ^2.3.2
    dev: @wayfair/app-c
  2.2.1
    dev: @wayfair/lib-a
```

## Configuration

The behavior of `@wayfair/one-version` can be configured by a `one-version.config.json` at the root of the repository.

The only configuration this currently supports is an object of dependency `overrides`. This may be useful while performing major upgrades.

```js

"overrides": {
  dependency: {
    versionSpecifier: [workspaceA, workspaceB]
  }
}
```

For example, the below config will allow `app-A` and `lib-L` to specify `react@^16.9`, even if the rest of the repo specifies `react@^17`.

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "react": {
      "^16.9": ["app-A", "lib-L"]
    }
  }
}
```
